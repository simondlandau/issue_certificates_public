</div>
      <p>There are three different permits which are distinguished from each other:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Permit as an insurance representative.</strong> As an insurance representative you are contractually bound to one or more insurance companies during your brokerages and therefore you represent the interests of these insurance companies.</li>
        <li><strong>Permit as an insurance broker.</strong> As an insurance broker, you broker insurance policies without being contractually bound to one or more insurance companies. You should represent the interests of insurance customers in a neutral manner when selecting suitable insurance products for them.</li>
        <li><strong>Permit as an insurance advisor.</strong> As an insurance advisor, you do not broker insurance. Therefore, you do not receive brokerage commission from the insurance companies and are also independent of these. You develop concepts for the correct customer-specific insurance coverage and the suitable insurance companies in this respect. You only work in the interests of the customers and are only paid by them.</li>
      </ul>
<ul>        <li>
  To obtain a permit, the following requirements typically apply:
  <ul>
    <li>reliability</li>
    <li>ordered financial circumstances</li>
    <li>a corresponding qualification</li>
    <li>a professional indemnity insurance policy</li>
  </ul>
<li>  The permit must be applied for prior to starting business activities.
</li>
<li>Our team assists applicants and existing intermediaries with documentation, renewals, and any compliance updates.</li>

      </ul>
